Fitshare is a start up aimed at disrupting the overly technical approach to 
tools used in the health and fitness industry. A lot of tools that are available
are very flashy and complicated, but they don't get people excited about their
fitness. We're here to change that.

## Our Vision

We want to see a world where people are excited to exercise and participate in their
own fitness journey. They can only do this if they're engaged and informed. Fitshare
strives for a simple approach that allows you to give your clients all the information
they need with as little fuss as possible. This allows your clients to focus on their
health instead of using an app.

## Our Mission

Fitness sharing, made easy. You shouldn't need an IT degree to share information with
your clients. That's why our mission is to provide the simplest platform for sharing
fitness-related information with your clients and keeping your time on non-core work
to a minimum.

## Our Pillars

### Simplicity

It should only ever take five minutes to create a plan.

### Enablement

Time spent on tech issues is time not spent with your clients. We're here to enable
you to work with your clients as much as possible.

### Transparency.

We're not here to hide fitness from clients. We make the process of sharing transparent
so your client remains a vital part of their own fitness journey.
