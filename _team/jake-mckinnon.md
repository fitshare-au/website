Jake is a founding director of Fitshare, and has been an MST for 7 years. He is the owner of Peninsula Physical Health and to say that Jake is obsessed with fitness and helping people is a severe understatement. From the moment he wakes up, he breathes MST. Jake works with clients 7 days a week, traveling all over the South East Queensland area to deliver treatment, works with local sports teams, and finds time to also do consulting work for sporting organisations throughout Queensland. 

Jake received his Bachelor's Degree in Health Science (Musculoskeletal Therapy) from the Endeavour College of Natural Health, and is a member of the Australian Natural Therapies Association, the registration body for natural therapies and MST in Australia.
